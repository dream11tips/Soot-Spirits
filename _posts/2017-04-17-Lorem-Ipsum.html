<p><strong>MIL VS BOS DREAM11&nbsp;</strong><strong>NBA Team Prediction 15th April 2018- Fantasy Team News</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boston Celtics vs Milwaukee Bucks</strong></p>
<p><strong>NBA Regular Season</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MIL VS BOS DREAM11 MATCH PREVIEW:</strong></p>
<p>This is the first match of NBA Playoffs 2018 for the Boston Celtics as the 16-times Champions host Milwaukee Bucks at TD Garden today at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics (55-27) finished the regular season at 2nd in the Eastern Conference, four games behind Toronto Raptors. They played their last game against Brooklyn Nets and won 110-97, while the last time Celts faced Bucks was on 4th April, which they lost 106-102.</p>
<p>The Greens are really a team that shoots pretty well. They are the 2nd team to score the most three-pointers this season, while they are sixth in defensive rebounds.</p>
<p>But Boston needs to work on their aggressive approach as they are only the 23rd best team in steals per game.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Bucks, on the other hand, finished the regular season at 7th after the conclusion of the regular season and lost their last game against Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
<p>The visitors are averaging 106.5 points per game this season while allowing 106.8 against them. That&rsquo;s a negative record and they need to work on their defensive duties if they are to long last in the NBA Playoffs 2018.</p>

<p><strong>INDIA FANTASY PREDICTION:</strong></p>
<p>Boston Celtics have won NBA Championship 16-times, though this is not that team that set the bar so high for all other teams, it&rsquo;s still the same franchise and the city that has witnessed that unparalleled success.</p>
<p>They are too big a team for Bucks at this stage. But Celtics are without key players and that&rsquo;s where history enters as Brad Stevens may use some heavy words to inspire his players ahead of this match.</p>
<p>A home win looks a good bet.</p>
